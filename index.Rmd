# Overview

The `Simple Word Prediction App` is based on a corpora from several blogs, news sites and twitter feeds.
It uses `Natural Language Processing` or `NLP` techniques to return the next word with the highest likelihood based on the previous 1,2 ... n words entered.

The app will also return several more words as prediction candidates.

# The Algorithm

The application is based on N-grams (1 to 3) and a back-off algorithm for when rare combinations of words is encountered.
 - A curated combined corpora of all 3 datasets (news, blogs, twitter) is being used
 - N-gram frequencies are calculated for the new dataset
 - Top 1+4 highest frequencies closest to the unigram, bigram or trigram are returned
